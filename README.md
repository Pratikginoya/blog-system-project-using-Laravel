# Blog System Project Using Larvel

After learning Laravel in detail with Ajax, I have made this project of Blog System with its Back-end (Admin) Panel to manage it

## About the project and Its Front-end,
- -> User can register and login her/him self
- -> After login, user can add the blog of his choice
- -> Afther that, this blog has go for the admin review (Blog status has been updated as "Pending for Admin Review...")
- -> (If blog is in "Pending for Admin Review" then it not visible for all other user and Like-comment of this blog is also disable)
- -> Now this new added blog will be review by the admin through back-end (Admin) panel (Admin can Reject or Approve the blog..)
- -> If blog has been approved by the admin then it will be Live for all user and Like-Comment also enable for all users..
- -> If blog has been rejected by the admin then it will not be Live and status has been updated as "Rejected by Admin due to Unsubjected content..."

- -> I have added pagination in list of blogs, so the it will be easy for the user to access...

  Here some screenshot of Front-end for your reference...
